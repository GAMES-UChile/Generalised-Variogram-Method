# Generalised-Variogram-Method

This repository contains the code used in

- Felipe Tobar, Elsa Cazelles and Taco de Wolff. Computationally-efficient initialisation of GPs: The generalised variogram method. *Transactions of Machine Learning Research*, in press, 2023. [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=slsAQHpS7n) & [arXiv][https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05394]

This repository contains the following files: 

- The files `waflgp.py` and `gpinit.py` defines the class, constructor and methods for the spectral and temporal distances respectively.
- The file `utils.py`, which contains simple auxiliary functions
- The Jupyer Notebook `Exp0_minimal_ex`, a minimal working example of our toolbox
- Notebooks `Exp1`, `Exp2`, `Exp3`, `Exp4`, `Exp5`, `Exp6`, `Exp7` replicate experiments in the paper.
- The data used for the experiments (heart-rate and audio)
